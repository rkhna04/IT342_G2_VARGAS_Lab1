User Registration and Authentication System

A full-stack User Registration and Authentication System developed for the IT342 laboratory requirement. This project demonstrates proper frontend–backend integration, secure authentication handling, and a clean, structured user interface.

📌 Overview

This application uses a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend to implement core authentication features such as user registration, login, logout, and profile viewing. The project follows standard development practices and is structured to allow future scalability.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend

Java

Spring Boot

Spring Security

REST APIs

Frontend

React

JavaScript

HTML

CSS

Database

MySQL (or any configured relational database)

✨ Features

User registration

Secure login and logout

Dashboard view after authentication

Profile section displaying basic user information

Clean and organized UI layout

Proper frontend–backend connection

📐 UI & Functional Requirements

Existing code logic and structure must remain unchanged.

A blank Dashboard layout is displayed as the default view after login.

A fully functional Profile button opens a Profile section showing:

Name

Email

User ID

Profile and Logout buttons are positioned in the upper-right corner of the interface.

The Dashboard section is placed on the opposite side of the layout from the Profile and Logout buttons.

UI alignment and spacing are kept clean and professional.
